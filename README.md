# Catalog-of-my-things

In this project, we create a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you won: 
Books, 
Music albums, 
Movies 
Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented. The data will be stored in JSON files but we will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.
