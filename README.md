# Catalog of my Things

In this project, we create a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you won: 
- Books 
- Music albums, 
- Games

Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented. The data will be stored in JSON files but we will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to your program's class structure.
